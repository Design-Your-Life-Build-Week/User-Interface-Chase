          <h2>The Good Time Journal</h2>
          <p>Based on the Design Your Life course at Stanford, this app helps you figure out which activities bring you enjoyment, energy, and engagement. These clues are the first step you need to take to design your ideal life. The journal includes an activity log and a reflection log.<br> <br>Activity logs record daily your main activities, and a gauge to show how engaged and energized you were. <br>Reflection logs are done once a week to record your trends, insights and surprises as to what activities work and don't work for you.
